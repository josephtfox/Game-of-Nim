# Game-of-Nim

Nim is a combinatorial game, where two players alternately take turns in taking objects from several heaps. The only rule is that each player must take at least one object on their turn, but they may take more than one object in a single turn, as long as they all come from the same heap.

Nim is the most well-known example of an impartial game, a game where both players have the same moves all the time, and thus the only distinguishing feature is that one player goes first. It is also completely solved, in the sense that the exact strategy has been found for any starting configuration.
